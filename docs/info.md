## How it works

It is an ALU which takes two 3bit numbers as inputs with 2 selection lines and does the operations such as addition, substraction, multiplication, division.
Function	F2 F1 F0	Description

## How to test

when sel0=0,sel1=0 addition 
when sel0=1,sel1=0 substraction
when sel0=0,sel1=1 multiplication
when sel0=1,sel1=1 division


## External hardware

This project was tested uising an Intel/Altera FPGA (EP2C20F484C7).
